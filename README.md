 I am Brendan Shanley and work in the Real Estate industry. I have been interested in the development of the FinTech space for several years and wanted to get a more formal training experience. 

 I am looking to use these skills to better improve the operations of my department if possible. We have an enormous amount of data that could be valuable to us, but no real way of analyzing it. 

 I see the FinTech skills in this course as complementary to what I am currently doing and if I find myself capable enough down the road I could see myself transitioning into a more FinTech oriented job.
